	<h3 class="QandA">QUESTION: But - isn't this site a lot like <a href="www.youtube.com">YouTube</a>?</h3>
	<p class="QandA">ANSWER: Totally!  YouTube is a great site for teaching and learning.  Anyone can upload videos to teach about any topic!  The site, though, is meant for school help.  There will not be any ads or other content that will distract you from learning awesome stuff from kids your age!</p>
